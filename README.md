This tool allows you to designate recipients, CC recipients, attachment files, signatures, and more.

It sends emails ​​individually​​ to designated recipients through the Outlook desktop software.

​​It is particularly suitable for scenarios requiring confidential content or attachments, where emails need to be sent one by one.​​

I have uploaded the file to the attachment; simply download it to use.

If you have VBA experience, you may also copy my source code to iterate and optimize it, making it better suited to personalized needs.
